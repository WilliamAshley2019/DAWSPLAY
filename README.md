IF YOU DO NOT HAVE VISUAL STUDIO 2026 installed do not download the first version only use the -rc version as the first version was built as a debug version. The -rc is built as a release an "should" work on systems without visual studio installed. I have only tested the -rc version on my own system which does have the debug dependencies. I am 
assuming that the dawsplay-rc.vst3  will work as a standalone .vst3 but this is ONLY tested on windows 11, I am not sure if it will work on windows 10.
